This is an emulator for the DCPU16 CPU in Notch's upcoming game 0x10c.
There are also a few code examples of very basic things, and a very rudimentary OS.
There is a description of the OS in the os/ directory.

Install:

    Graphical:

    1. Install SFML (http://www.sfml-dev.org/)

    2. On linux all you have to do is run make.
        a. On Mac you will need to create a new Xcode project but it should work fine without any modification
        b. On Windows, you'll need to do a bit of modification to emu.cpp to make it launch. Atleast in Visual Studio 2010

    
    Command Line
    
    1. No external libraries needed
    
    2. Compile like you normally would, depending on your OS.

Usage:

./dcppu <flags> <filename>

    Flags
        -d  Outputs a memory dump file called mem.dump after the CPU finishes running.
            
            
Assembling code:

I do not have an assembler, but there are a lot out there. I use deNull's assembler
and emulator. (http://denull.ru/dcpu/dcpu.htm). Very good debugger as well.


To-do:

- Clean up code, in both the emulator, os.dasm
